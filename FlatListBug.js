This React Native bug is related to unexpected behavior when using the `FlatList` component with a large dataset and complex item rendering logic.  The problem manifests as slow scrolling, janky animations, and occasional crashes. The root cause is often inefficient rendering or data management practices, leading to dropped frames and UI inconsistencies.  Specifically, the issue arises when the `renderItem` function performs expensive computations or manipulates the DOM excessively within each rendered item.  This can include complex calculations, network requests within the `renderItem` method itself, or inefficient component structure within each list item.
