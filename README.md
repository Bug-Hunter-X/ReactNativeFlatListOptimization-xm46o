This repository demonstrates a common performance issue in React Native's FlatList component when dealing with large datasets and complex item rendering. The `FlatListBug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `FlatListBugSolution.js` provides an optimized solution. The problem stems from inefficient data handling and rendering within the `renderItem` method, resulting in slow scrolling, dropped frames, and potential crashes. The solution involves optimizing data processing and using techniques like memoization, virtualization (using `windowSize` and `removeClippedSubviews`), and efficient component structure to improve rendering performance.  Read the comments in each file for detailed explanations.
